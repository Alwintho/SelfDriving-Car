# SelfDriving-Car
//This is a project I designed and excuted with a team where we built a car from scratch and attached color, touch, and a ultrasonic sensor to steer our car through a maze as fast as possible.
// Another factor of the car was that it needed to safley transport a wheelchaired passenger to the finish line in which we built a arm to pick up the passenger from the back of out vechicle and brough them safely to the destination( Disclaimer this was a miniacture wheelchair)
